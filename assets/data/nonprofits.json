The lack of access to healthy food is on the rise for those living in scarcity, resulting in a dramatic increase in obesity. Eighty percent of Hennepin County Medical Center’s clients live below the poverty line and the number one diagnosis is diabetes. Together with HCMC dietitians, Matter has crafted a healthy food box to ensure that our neighbors across Hennepin County living with food insecurity have access to healthy and nutritious meals. In addition to shelf-stable single serve lunches and family-style dinners, each box includes education on healthy eating and recipes.
