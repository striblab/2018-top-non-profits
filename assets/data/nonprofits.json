APMG changed the recurring term of its Sustaining Membership agreement from annual to monthly; now we are recording revenue from Sustainers as it is received each month instead of recording the total amount of an annual pledge from Sustainers. This change was necessary to support new gift processing technology and to meet the changing philanthropic expectations of our donors.\n\nFrom a financial reporting perspective, this change is most visible in the Consolidated Statement of Activities (page 4 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements) and Schedule of Operating Fund and Long-term Activities (page 27 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements), which caused a one-time $11,671,000 decrease in Individual Gifts and Membership support and Change in Net Assets line items. More information about the change is included in footnote 2 of the report (page 10 of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nWhile this change caused a one-time reduction in revenue recorded in fiscal year 2018, it did not in any way change the actual level of support from Sustainers or affect the amount of cash flow provided by our Sustaining Members. Revenues will substantially recover in fiscal year 2019 with this change now fully implemented.\n","id":4922,"inputsource":"Automatically imported from 2018 survey.","modified_date":"2018-12-03T08:40:49.510000","programservicerevenue":22026000,"publishyear":2018,"resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/nonprofit_finances/4922/","revenue":134704000,"source":"Consolidated financial statement"},{"added":"2017-12-11","annualreportdate":"2017-06-30","coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/363503764/","contribgrants":113786000,"created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:46.037051","eoybalance":269841984,"excess":29618000,"expenses":138428992,"fiscalyearend":"2017-06-30","footnotes":"Compensation for McTaggart is for the 2016 calendar year, which is the latest compensation information available.","fundraisingexpenses":19221000,"id":4477,"inputsource":"Automatically imported from 2017 survey.","investgainslosses":11267000,"managementgeneralexpenses":11428000,"modified_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:47.102109","programserviceexpense":107780000,"programservicerevenue":18713000,"publishyear":2017,"resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/nonprofit_finances/4477/","revenue":168047008,"source":"Consolidated financial statement"}],"officers":[{"coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/363503764/","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:49.840460","director":0,"dropped":0,"first":"Mark","gender":"M","id":11701,"last":"Alfuth","modified_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:50.716532","resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/officer/11701/","title":"CFO","hasImage":false},{"coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/363503764/","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:49.840460","director":0,"dropped":0,"first":"William","gender":"M","id":9630,"last":"Kling","modified_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:50.716532","resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/officer/9630/","title":"Pres., CEO","hasImage":false},{"coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/363503764/","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:49.840460","director":0,"dropped":0,"first":"Jon","gender":"M","id":11733,"last":"McTaggart","modified_date":"2018-12-03T08:40:49.355000","nonprofit_salaries":[{"added":"2018-12-03","benefit":46829,"bonus":163631,"ceo":1,"created_date":"2018-12-03T07:50:29.026000","deferred":17225,"fiscalyearend":"2018-06-30","footnotes":"Compensation for McTaggart is the calendar year information from the most recent filed 990 (the year ended 6/30/2017)","id":6499,"modified_date":"2018-12-03T08:40:49.432000","officerid":{"coid":{"added":"2017-11-21","address1":"480 Cedar St","alpha":"American Public","category":"Other","city":"St Paul","class_field":"1","coid":"363503764","companyhistory":"Minnesota Communication Group changed its name to American Public Media Group in 2001.

We provide food for the hungry, shelter for the homeless, rehabilitation for those in the grip of addiction, and so much more. The officers (ordained ministers), licensed social workers and business professionals who work for The Salvation Army believe in our mission of spreading the love of Jesus Christ without discrimination. Our six service areas include:\r\n\r\n        Basic Needs\r\nThe Salvation Army saves people struggling to survive by providing food, clothing, temporary shelter and assistance with rent, utilities and transportation.\r\n\r\n        Youth Services\r\nIn many inner-city neighborhoods, The Salvation Army can be a child’s only source of good. We offer after-school and summer programs, sports, music, daycare, Bible study and other vital activities.\r\n        Disaster Services\r\nWhen tornadoes, floods and other calamities hit, survivors rely on The Salvation Army for food, hydration, spiritual support and long-term case management.\r\n\r\n        Housing\r\nThe Salvation Army provides shelter to youth and adults needing housing for one night, one week, one year – even a decade. Most programs offer on-site case management to promote self-sufficiency.\r\n\r\n        Rehabilitation\r\nOur long- and short-term rehabilitation programs offer counseling, spiritual training and personalized support. Most are free programs funded by thrift store sales and kettle donations.\r\n\r\n        Counseling\r\nThe Salvation Army provides counseling services to people with varying degrees of need. We offer quality counseling at prisons and assisted living facilities, and at our rehabilitation centers, housing facilities, and Worship and Service Centers.","employees":[{"added":"2018-12-03","coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/410698597/","created_date":"2018-12-03T07:51:02.544000","id":6108,"modified_date":"2018-12-03T08:41:15.195000","publishyear":2018,"resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/employees/6108/","total":735},{"added":"2017-12-11","coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/410698597/","created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:43.248778","id":5624,"modified_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:43.799788","publishyear":2017,"resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/employees/5624/","total":784}],"enteredby":"2016","irsno":"410698597","modified_date":"2018-12-03T15:00:50.289334","name":"Salvation Army - Northern Division","nonprofit_finances":[{"added":"2018-12-03","annualreportdate":"2017-09-30","coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/410698597/","contribgrants":53966471,"created_date":"2018-12-03T07:51:02.759000","eoybalance":17795118,"excess":1423769,"expenses":66892096,"fiscalyearend":"2017-09-30","id":4988,"inputsource":"Automatically imported from 2018 survey.","modified_date":"2018-12-03T08:41:15.348000","programservicerevenue":10753172,"publishyear":2018,"resource_uri":"/data-ui/api/v01/nonprofit_finances/4988/","revenue":68315865,"source":"Consolidated financial statement"},{"added":"2017-12-11","annualreportdate":"2016-09-30","coid":"/data-ui/api/v01/company/410698597/","contribgrants":56072384,"created_date":"2018-05-08T09:55:46.037051","eoybalance":16371350,"excess":350823,"expenses":71431280,"fiscalyearend":"2016-09-30","footnotes":"Richardson was named new leader of the Salvation Army in June 2016.

Since 1969, People Incorporated has served as a “safety net” provider of mental health services for individuals with few other options. But in recent years, the organization has been reshaped from the inside out, resulting in significant growth and improved client outcomes – changes now paying off with national recognition.\nPeople Incorporated believes that addressing community mental health needs improves lives and livelihoods throughout the Twin Cities; mental health is community health. With upwards of 750 employees, 40 locations and nearly 60 programs from homeless services to clinical services, People Incorporated acts on innovative ideas incredibly quickly and efficiently. Every employee is empowered to help the organization continuously adapt to, and lead the way in, today’s changing health care environment.\nPeople Incorporated was named one of a small number of participants in a new nationwide initiative. In the fall of 2016, it was certified as a pilot site for a new U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiative called the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC). Because People Incorporated’s structure has already been moving in a direction that aligns with the forward-thinking goals of CCBHC, it is ideally suited for this national pilot program.  \nIn addition, People Incorporated goes above and beyond in many small and large actions every day. The organization sets aside one percent of its budget to provide access to care for individuals with no health coverage or unaffordable insurance deductibles. And in 2016, People Incorporated staff donated more than $20,000 out of their own pockets for client needs such as bus fare, clothing and other items that can become barriers to success. \nThe organization also prides itself on its progressive workforce. People Incorporated has strong women leadership with Jill Wiedemann-West as CEO, and four of the six VPs also being women. Furthermore, 33% of hires made are employees who self-identify as minorities. The company is devoted to creating a culture of learning, developing a leadership program for clinicians to move into management roles. \nJill Wiedemann-West joined People Incorporated, Minnesota’s largest community-based provider of mental health services, as its first Chief Operating Officer in 2010 and became its Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Ms. Wiedemann-West’s professional background and experience is in healthcare operations, management and service development. \nMs. Wiedemann-West holds a Master of Arts in Psychology and Human Behavior from National University in San Diego, and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Social Work from the University of Wisconsin – Madison. Before joining People Incorporated, she was COO at Hazelden Foundation for 11 years.\nPeople Incorporated has made significant differences in the lives of those in the community who are struggling with mental health and its related issues.

Award-winning Minnesota Orchestra ranks among America’s top symphonic ensembles, with a distinguished history of acclaimed performances in its home state and around the world. It is known for award-winning recordings and international touring, as well as for notable educational engagement programs and a commitment to new orchestral repertoire.
